# BallotBoxDJ
Welcome to BallotBoxDJ!

BallotBoxDJ is an application currently under development for iOS. The objective of this app is to utilize the Spotify SDK to manipulate the playback of songs within a playlist on a single iPhone device (the host) from the consensus of multiple users (the guests).
There are two nominees of songs within the host's selected playlist which get nominated every time a new song is played as well as a random option for a randomly selected song in the playlist.
